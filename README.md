# Intel® Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree 

This repository contains the projects completed in the Udacity's *Intel® Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree* as a part of **Intel® Edge AI Scholarship Program - 2020**.

The course introduces to the basics of AI at the Edge, leverage pre-trained models available with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit™, 
convert and optimize other models with the Model Optimizer, and perform inference with the Inference Engine. 
Also we will learn topics for edge applications, like MQTT and how to stream video to servers.
Gives insights into choosing the right hardware (CPU, VPU, FPGA, and Integrated GPU) for the project. 
We can also distribute workload on available compute devices in order to improve model performance.
We also, learn how to optimize our model and application code to reduce inference time when running model at the edge.
